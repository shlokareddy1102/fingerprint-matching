Fingerprint-Based Criminal Identification System

A C++ project that simulates a lightweight, logic-driven biometric system for matching crime scene fingerprints with a criminal database. This system implements Minutiae-Based Fingerprint Analysis along with advanced matching strategies like Zonal Matching and Graph-Based Relational Matching, entirely using core C++ with STL.

Developed as an academic project to explore biometric matching techniques using data structures and algorithms.
OBJECTIVE

To develop a command-line tool that enables:

Storage and retrieval of fingerprint data
Matching fingerprints with high confidence
Detection of criminal networks and accomplices
All using efficient C++ logic and file handling, without external libraries
Matching Techniques Explained

1. üó∫Ô∏è Zonal Matching

The fingerprint is logically divided into zones (like a grid).
Each zone holds its own minutiae features (endpoints, bifurcations).
Matching is performed zone-by-zone, increasing robustness for partial/unclear prints.
Similarity score is calculated by comparing minutiae counts and types per zone.
This simulates how real-world biometric systems handle noisy or partial fingerprint inputs.
2. üåê Graph-Based Relational Matching

Each fingerprint is modeled as a graph, where:
Nodes = minutiae points
Edges = spatial/geometric relationships
Matching involves comparing graph structures (e.g., relative angles, distances)
This helps detect unique structural patterns, not just point-to-point similarity
This mirrors complex matching done in AI/ML-powered biometric engines.
